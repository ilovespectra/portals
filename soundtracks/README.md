These pNFTs on Solana that represent the commission of a personalized soundtrack to your space.<br><br><b>

## They're called SNDTRK Tokens. Here's how they work:
They will be released in 4 tiers, or 'SetLists', which will be released one at a time chronologically.<br> 
  - SNDTRK SetLists:
      -
    - **TailGate / 4SOL** - 10 Tokens (*Live Now:*) [Check it out](https://ilovespectra.vercel.app)
    - **Opener / 6SOL** - 10 Tokens
    - **Headliner / 8SOL** - 10 Tokens
    - **Encore / 10SOL** - No Capped Supply

- Each pNFT represents a custom track for your portals space based on the following information you will be prompted to provide in the UI, which will be logged as a memo in the transaction signature:
  - Genre:
    - Action, Adventure, Fantasy, Sci-fi, Shooter, Racing, Chase/Scroller, Bullet Hail
      - *Got suggestions for more? Make a pull request!)*
  - Mood:
    - Intense, Calm, Mysterious, Joyful, Romance, Suspense
  - Game Setting:
    - Describe the game environment here
  - Personality(s)
    - Describe the lead character, or player

In exchange for SOL, I will immerse myself in your space and get a feel for the atmosphere and create a sound track of your choice:
- The track will be ~10 minutes and loop neatly
- Optional Custom AI Generated vocal greeting; ie. "Welcome to _____."
- Many genres available: electronic or analog
