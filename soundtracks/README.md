# Custom Portals Soundtracks

[Here is an Audius playlist](https://audius.co/hntdenver/playlist/soundtrack-demos-1479347224) of some examples of original tracks I've created under my iLoveSpectra artist moniker.<br><br>
I'm creating an NFT collection on Solana that represents the commission of a personalized soundtrack to your space, if you have any interest, find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ilovespectra) or @_tanny on Discord.

In exchange for SOL, I will immerse myself in your space and get a feel for the atmosphere and create a sound track of your choice:
- The track will be ~10 minutes and loop neatly
- Optional Custom AI Generated vocal greeting; ie. "Welcome to _____."
- Many genres available: electronic or analog
