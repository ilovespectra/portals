# Custom Avatars in Portals

You can add `&glbavatar2022=true` to the end of any Portals address and import your own GLBs, but there's a few tricks to make this as easy as possible.<br><br>
You can easily copy the command here:
```
&glbavatar2022=true
```
If you've been given a GLB of your TNEC avatar, you can import it directly in the Portals loading screen and it will work perfectly. If you'd like to import your character as a GLB or NPC, that may take a little extra work. I'll show you how to make it happen.

## Download Blender

[Download Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/), a free modeling application. It's very complex, has many layers, and a dramatic learning curve. We're going to take a few shortcuts to get you to the top of the class.

## Create a Mixamo Account

[Head over to Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/) and create an account. This Adobe webpage will animate your avatar to give it live idle animations.

## Import your GLB to Mixamo

In order to do so, you'll need to convert the file to an FBX, OBJ, or ZIP. You can convert your GLB to these formats using [this converter](https://imagetostl.com/convert/file/glb/to/fbx), which works [the other way](https://imagetostl.com/convert/file/fbx/to/glb) just as easily. Your other option is to import the GLB in Blender, then export as your desired format. 
You can get a GLB from [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/) but you can typically also download the other formats directly. 

## Select an Animation

Choose an animation that you like, preferably a short one that loops well for better loading. 

## Reload you animation back into Blender

You'll need to reskin your avatar. You can do so by copy pasting all the contents from the GLB file. Simply import them beside one another and drag and drop.

## Demo

Screenshots of all of this to come, gtg to work rn but wanted to share this because I'm excited about it.
