# Portals Grey Hat

I'm convinced the only limitation of the different portals passes is the quantity of simultaneous visitors. If you're a new builder and don't expect high traffic, you can create complex and engaging worlds using the portals/spawn points functions in your Genesis pods.<br><br>
I'll demonstrate how you can use `B` to navigate outside the walls of your pod and import glb files of larger rooms, or even worlds to spawn into.. with no loading screen!<br><br>

When you purchase a TNEC nft from any secondary marketplace, you are given this Genesis pod to build in. Most of the available items in the inventory are too large to fit in the available floorspace. Why is that, you may wonder? <i>There is a larger world out there!</i><br><br>
When you enter your Genesis pod Portal it will look like this.
